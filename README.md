Speech Recognition System


This project is a **Speech Recognition Web Application** that allows users to either:
- Record audio in real-time using their **microphone**.
- Upload an existing **MP3 or WAV audio file**.

It then processes the audio and performs speech-to-text transcription using **Google Speech Recognition API**.

---

## Features
-  Record live audio from your microphone via the browser.
-  Upload MP3 or WAV audio files.
-  Automatically converts MP3 to WAV format if necessary.
-  Processes the audio using `speech_recognition`.
-  Uses Google’s Speech Recognition API for transcription.
-  Gracefully handles errors (e.g., unrecognized audio, API issues).
-  Simple web interface powered by **Gradio**.

##  How It Works
1. User visits the web page hosted via **Gradio**.
2. They can either:
    - Record audio live using the microphone.
    - Upload an MP3/WAV audio file.
3. If the uploaded file is MP3, it is converted to WAV format.
4. The audio is processed using Python’s `speech_recognition` library.
5. Google API performs the transcription.
6. Transcribed text is displayed in the web interface.
